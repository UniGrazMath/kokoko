title: Graphs with 2-regular distance-2 graphs
session: Afternoon Session

The distance-2 graph of a graph has edges between vertices that have distance 2 in the
original graph. In this talk we ask: What are the graphs whose distance-2 graphs are
2-regular? We provide a complete and explicit characterization, rounding off with a few
other results and a discussion of the corresponding counting sequences.
