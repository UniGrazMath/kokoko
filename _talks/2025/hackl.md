title: The surprising distribution of the global dimension of linear Nakayama algebras
session: Open Problem Session
---

For a positive integer $n$, an $n$-Nakayama algebra $A$ is a finite-dimensional algebra over some field $\mathbb{F}$ that can be constructed as a quotient algebra $A = \mathbb{F}Q / I$, where $Q$ is a linear or cyclic quiver on $n$ vertices (i.e., $0 \to 1 \to \cdots \to n-1$ or $0 \to 1 \to \cdots \to n-1 \to 0$), $\mathbb{F}Q$ is the corresponding path algebra, and $I$ is a suitable two-sided ideal. A quantity that is particularly interesting for algebraists is the global dimension of $A$, which is defined as the maximal projective dimension of a simple module of $A$.

There is a well-known bijection that maps a "linear" $n$-Nakayama algebra to a Dyck path. Under this correspondence, the simple modules relevant for determining the global dimension of $A$ are mapped to even-parity integer points on and under the Dyck path. From this representation, their dimensions can be determined following a simple recursive scheme. Intriguingly, experiments suggest that the global dimension follows the same distribution as the height of Dyck paths -- for which we do not yet have a proper explanation.

In this talk we consider the global dimension from a purely combinatorial point of view. After walking through known results, we discuss the evidence for our conjecture linking path height and global dimension. In particular, we present a hand full of strategies that have not (yet) led to a successful proof.
