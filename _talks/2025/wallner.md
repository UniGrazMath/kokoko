title: Enumerating king walks avoiding a quadrant
session: Morning Session
---

We continue the enumeration of plane lattice walks with small steps avoiding the negative
quadrant, initiated by Bousquet-Mélou in 2016. We solve in detail a new case, namely the
king model where all eight nearest neighbour steps are allowed. The associated generating
function satisfies an algebraicity pheonomeon: it is the sum of a simple, explicit $D$-finite
series (related to the number of walks confined to the first quadrant), and an algebraic one.
The principle of the approach is the same as in [Bousquet-Mélou, 2016], but challenging
theoretical and computational difficulties arise as we now handle algebraic series of degree
up to 216. This is joint work with Mireille Bousquet-Mélou.
