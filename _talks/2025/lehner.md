Sums of powers of cotangents of the form

$$ \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \cot^m \frac{\alpha + k\pi}{n} $$

have been studied in various contexts in the mathematical literature, like number theory
and topology. We give an explicit elementary evaluation of these sums in terms of certain
integer valued polynomials with positive coefficients, whose combinatorial interpretation
remains an open question.
