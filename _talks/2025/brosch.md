title: Combinatoric Derivations and Sidorenko's Conjecture
session: Afternoon Session

Sidorenko’s conjecture can be formulated as "Let $H$ be a bipartite graph, and $\rho \in [0, 1]$. Of
all the graphs with edge density $\rho$, the graph(-limit) obtained by picking edges uniformly
at random minimizes the homomorphism density of $H$." This conjecture, first formulated
in 1991 by Sidorenko, has received considerable attention over the last decades, and yet
remains open in the general case. It was shown recently [Blekherman, Raymond, Singh,
Thomas, 2020] that sums-of-squares in Razborov’s flag algebra are not strong enough to
prove even small, known cases of the conjecture. To circumvent this, we introduce a novel
kind of (Lie-)derivation of flags. Due to their combinatoric nature, we can use them to
systematically gain knowledge on global minimizers of problems in extremal graph theory.
We combine them with the flag algebra method to find new proofs for various cases of
Sidorenko’s conjecture.
