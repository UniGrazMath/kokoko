A _partition_ of an integer $n$ is a finite sequence of positive
integers $p_1 \geq p_2 \geq \cdots \geq p_k$ such that
$n = p_1 + p_2 + \cdots + p_k$. We let $p(n)$ denote the number
of partitions of $n$. For example, $p(4) = 5$ because there are
five partitions of the integer $n = 4$:

$$
4,\quad 3 + 1,\quad 2 + 2,\quad 2 + 1 + 1,\quad 1 + 1 + 1 + 1
$$

In 1919, just one year before his death, Ramanujan discovered and proved
some unexpected, and truly amazing, divisibility properties for the function
$p(n)$. Since then, several mathematicians have studied $p(n)$
from different perspectives, trying to better understand these divisibility properties, especially from a combinatorial perspective. In the process,
numerous "statistics" have been defined on partitions, including the rank and crank of a
partition. In this talk, I will discuss this history in more detail, and then I will transition to
some relatively new partition statistics, including the _missing excludant_
(or _mex_) of a partition.
I will discuss unexpected connections between this mex statistic and the crank, and
then we will transition to some very recent work of Blecher and Knopfmacher on partition
fixed points which, unbeknownst to them, is very closely connected to the crank and mex
statistics. We will close by generalizing this concept of partition fixed points and show how
this new family of functions naturally connects with generalized versions of the aforemen-
tioned partition statistics. This is joint work with Brian Hopkins (St. Peterâ€™s University),
Dennis Stanton (University of Minnesota), and Ae Ja Yee (Penn State University).
