title: Enumeration of generalized Motzkin paths with negative boundary
session: Afternoon Session
---

Banderier and Flajolet did a thorough study of the enumeration of four types of directed
lattice paths (walks, bridges, meanders, and excursions), where they derived generating
functions for each type of path using the kernel method. In recent years, a further family
of lattice paths has started to be considered by lattice path combinatorialists: paths which
start and end on the $x$-axis, are allowed within some region below the $x$-axis but need to
stay above a negative level $t$ for a given $t\in\mathbb{N}$. The $k_t$-Dyck paths with negative boundary
have been the subject of a number of studies, Motzkin paths with negative boundary, apart
from special cases, have not yet been studied. This talk will explore, how one can derive
the enumerative generating function for generalized Motzkin paths with negative boundary
by using the kernel method.
