title: $\top$-avoiding rectangulations and inversion sequences
session: Morning Session
---

We investigate rectangulations that avoid $\top$-like patterns -- the pattern ‚ä§ and its rotations. For every combination of such patterns, we enumerate the respective aviodance class.
In particular, we show that $\top$-avoiding generic rectangulations are in bijection with several classes of inversion sequences, among them
$I(010, 110, 120, 210)$ and $I(011, 201)$: this
provides a proof for the conjecture (Yan and Lin, 2019) that these classes are enumerated
by the same sequence. Joint work with Michaela Polley.
